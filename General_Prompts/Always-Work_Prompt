How to ensure Always Works delivery```ease ensure your solution Always Works```r: $ARGUMENTS. Follow```is systematic```proach: [file:1]

Core Philosophy
- “Should work” ≠ “does work” — pattern```tching isn```enough. [file:1]
- Outcomes beat outputs — the job is```lving the real```oblem, not```mpleting a```ecklist. [file:1]
- Untested work is a guess, not a solution```file:1]

The 30-Second Reality Check — Must answer YES``` ALL
- Did I execute the exact change end```-end in a realistic environment? [file:1]
- Did I trigger the precise scenario``` user journey```at changed```file:1]
- Did I personally observe the expected```sult (UI/UX, API, content, device, ops), including error states? [file:1]
- Did I check logs/alerts/messages for```lent errors``` regressions? [file:1]
- Would I bet $100 this works as intended for the target```dience and```ntext? [file:1]

Phrases to Avoid
- “This should work now.” [file:1]
- “I’ve fixed the issue.” (especially on the 2nd+ attempt) [file:1]
- “Try it now.” (without trying it personally, end-to-end) [file:1]
- “The logic/spec is correct so…” [file:1]

Specific Test Requirements (adapt per task)
- User-facing experiences: Click/tap/voice```rough the actual```ow; validate```ates, copy```inks, accessibility```nd error handling```file:1]
- Communications/content: Preview in```nal channel```; verify formatting, links, variables```aceholders, audience```rgeting, and```heduling. [file:1]
- Data/config changes: Apply in a safe```vironment; query```spect the source``` truth; verify```llout, rollback```nd persistence```ross restarts. [file:1]
- Process/policy changes: Dry-run the full workflow with realistic```puts; confirm```ndoffs, SL``` approvals```nd auditability. [file:1]
- Integrations/external services: Make```al test calls```th test accounts```onfirm request```sponse shape```etries, time```s, and idempotency. [file:1]
- Automation/scripts/jobs: Execute on```presentative```ta; confirm```de effects```dempotency, re```n behavior, and failure alerts. [file:1]
- Analytics/metrics: Trigger events;```lidate they```nd in downstream```nks/dashboards with```rrect schema```d dimensions```file:3]
- Physical operations/hardware: Perform```-device/on-site checks; verify safety, tolerances```nd acceptance```iteria. [file:1]
- AI/LLM prompts/workflows: Run a small```v set; verify```hema validity```efusal/safety behavior```nd grounded```s against references```file:2][file:4]
- Localization/legal/compliance: Obtain```alified review```onfirm disclaim```, jurisdiction```rules, and```stricted terms```file:1]
- Configuration/release: Restart/redeploy```onfirm health```ecks, logs```e clean, and```ature flags```llouts behave``` expected. [file:1]

The Embarrassment Test
“If a user records trying this and it```ils, would```feel embarrassed```tching their```ce?” If yes```t’s not done```file:1]

Time Reality
- Time saved skipping tests: ~30 seconds. [file:1]
- Time wasted when it doesn’t work: ~```minutes (or much more). [file:1]
- Trust lost: Immeasurable. [file:1]

Usage notes
- Replace $ARGUMENTS with the exact scope```udience, environments```nd critical```enarios to``` verified, then```ep this prompt```tached to the```sk as a living```ceptance checklist```file:1]
- For AI/LLM tasks, add a tiny dev set```d a simple```ss/fail schema```le to catch```gressions determin```ically, then```n the “30-Second Reality Check” on a few edge```ses. [file:2][file:4]
- Use this as a gate: work is complete```ly when each```levant “Specific Test```quirement” is```monstrated```d the Embarrassment Test``` passed with```nfidence. [file:1]
